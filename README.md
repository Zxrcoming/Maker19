### Project Name
 Light

### Project Description

![](https://github.com/Zxrcoming/Maker19/blob/master/Picture/1.gif)

This is a Trafic Light project.
- **In gerneral**
```vim
    We're doing this because we found that
    there're some problems whit the tranditional trafic light
    we will change the way the light behave to people who see it.
    IN A funning and useful way.
```

- **Details**

  - *We use opencv as our core of tech,and we use Serial Port to display people on the screen*

  - *Because a lot of people used to watching their phones whit heads down when walkacross crosswalk,so we provide light-changable crosswalk which can change to green when Trafic ligh is green and to red when Trafic light is red,then people can easily know when to go and stop*

  - *We use some simple material to perform the crosswalk like little LEDs on the board to display the same color of the Trafic Light*

  - *And the LEDs can change their light continuely when the Trafic green time is running to let people directly know the remaining time of the green Trafic Light*

- **Advantages**
  - ***when the Trafic Light turns red,people may will feel bored when waitting for the green coming,and our product provide a very funny way to comfor people , therefor the Trafic light is not just a Trafic Light, it can capture your image and display it on the screen,although it is just a Matchman(火柴人),but it could be just fun***

  - ***And our LED crosswalk is audio-visual for people to see directly and to understand in mind what is the remaining time of the walking***



### Users
Everyone living on the earth.

### How to do it.


  - Using Ardiuno MEGE 2560 and 32x32 LEDs to replace the traditional trafic light.

  - And we added the opencv tech to display people's movement on our LEDs.

  - Also  we use another LEDs to replace the crosswalk road.
